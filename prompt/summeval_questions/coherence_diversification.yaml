definition: 
  summeval: the collective quality of all sentences. The summary should be well-structured and well-organized. The summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic.

sub_aspect:
    Topic Maintenance:
        Does the summary consistently focus on the central topic without deviating into unrelated areas?
        Are there any sentences in the summary that introduce irrelevant information that detracts from the central topic? 
        Does each sentence in the summary contribute meaningfully to the central topic without redundant information?

    Logical Flow:
        Does the summary present information in a logical order?
        Does the summary avoid abrupt transitions between sentences or ideas?
        Do sentences naturally build on each other to enhance understanding of the central topic? 
        Is each piece of information introduced at an appropriate point in the summary, avoiding unnecessary backtracking or repetition?

    Consistent Point of View:
        Is the point of view or perspective in the summary consistent with the source?
        Does the summary maintain a consistent tone and perspective throughout? 
        Are pronouns and references used consistently to avoid confusion about the subject or entities being discussed?
